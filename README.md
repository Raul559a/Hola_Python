Here you'll find notes, exercises and other things related with python, its a free repository to help people get a better understanding about this languages and its capabilites.

### How to use it

OK! I know if you are a rookie here can be confusing to know how to use this repository properly, but I'll give you some hints about it.

1. It's order by folders, each folder contains specific information related to the topic (yep, according to the topic is the name of the folder).
2. Inside each folder you'll find theory, solved exercises, some tasks to do and some challenges.
3. If you solve the task or a challenge feel free to make a pull request (PR) Trust me, its better when we share our knowledge


   
   **Note**

   If you don't know how to do a PR, I'll teach you later ðŸ˜… On the other hand, if we have presential classes I'll do it during the class
